              On your return journey from Dharmasthala, we include a special stop at the revered 
              Sowthadka Shree Mahaganapati Temple, a rare open-air temple located in a peaceful

            <p className="mt-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600">
              This temple is famous for the idol of Lord Ganesha, which is uniquely placed in the 
              open without a Garbhagriha. Devotees believe that prayers offered here bring blessings 
              for success, obstacle removal, and inner strength.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mt-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600">
              The temple is especially known for fulfilling the wishes of devotees related to education, 
              marriage, and business. Its peaceful atmosphere and unique design make this visit a must 
              for all spiritual travelersâ€”the perfect way to end your Dharmasthala pilgrimage on a divine note.
